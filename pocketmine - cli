Issues
=======
The official release from https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/releases/latest refers to it being 
"For Minecraft: PE v0.10.5 alpha", but the IOS version is 0.13.1 (as of Jan 4 2016)

So, the development builds says "he build 1266 using API 1.13.1 was released on Sat, 19 Dec 2015 23:41:43 GMT"

Here - the API matches the IOS version
