Plugins (14): PurePerms v1.0.8, VoteReward v2.1, WorldGM v3, BanItem v2.1, SignPortal v1.1.2, EssentialsPE v1.0.2, Whois v2.0.3, CommandSigns v2, Pundler v1.3, ChatCensor v1.4, ServerMail v0.0.2, iProtector v3.0, PocketGuard v2.1.1, SimpleAuth v1.6.0

Some of which are nowhere near actually being setup (lol) and this seems to cause quite a lot of stability problems.
